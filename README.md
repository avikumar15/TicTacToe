# TicTacToeHackermode
An app which lets you play TicTacToe in 1-Player mode with three different levels of difficulty and also 2-Player mode. The app also runs a timer when game starts which stops once the game is over. For each succesful wins by the player, the app stores the time taken to win along with the difficulty level. The app shows this detailed result in a new activity which can be reset if needed. On the first screen app also shows the best time at which the player won.
